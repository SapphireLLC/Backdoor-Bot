# Backdoor-Bot
This is a basic outline/framework of a Discord bot. The main function of this bot is to add a backdoor which will allow the owner to remotely take control of a server, it also allows the operator to act as a server admin while hiding behind the safety of the bot. You will need to add the basic functionality that you would like, this allows the operator the freedom to do whatever they want with minimal effort. 

#SAPPHIRE LLC IS NOT RESPONSABLE FOR ANY LEGAL TROUBLE THIS BOT MAY GET YOU IN.

This an image of the permissions and things the bot is capable of doing and controlling:
